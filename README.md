### Introduction
A new hybrid page layout analysis algorithm is
proposed, which uses bottom-up methods to form an
initial data-type hypothesis and locate the tab-stops
that were used when the page was formatted. The
detected tab-stops, are used to deduce the column
layout of the page. The column layout is then applied
in a top-down manner to impose structure and
reading-order on the detected regions.
The complete C++ source code implementation is
available as part of the Tesseract open source OCR
engine at http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr.
